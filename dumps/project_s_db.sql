And even if you’re not growing bamboo on an industrial scale, you can think of all sorts of reasons to plant it in your own home garden.', 'The benefits of cultivating and using bamboo are almost endless, and you can read all about them in our article What’s so great about bamboo? And even if you’re not growing bamboo on an industrial scale, you can think of all sorts of reasons to plant it in your own home garden.\r\n\r\nBut before you start planting bamboo, you need to be sure you know what you’re doing. Bamboo, after all, is a mighty plant. Sometimes it seems to have a mind of its own. So if you’re not well informed and prepared, you might just end up with a great mess on your hands.\r\n\r\nIn order to help you get the most out of your bamboo, and to make the most out of your garden, we’ve prepared a comprehensive how-to guide. This should include everything you need to know about growing bamboo. From choosing the best varieties for your landscape, to watering, pruning and transplanting, we cover it all. For even more, check out our glossary of bamboo terminology.\r\n\r\nAnd by following these basic instructions, you should be able to create a lush and beautiful garden. Of course, it helps to have a green thumb, but it’s certainly not essential. Even your thumb isn’t green already, it will be by the time you get through this how-guide and spend a few weekends among the rhizomes.\r\n\r\nDISCLOSURE: Some of the links in this article are affiliate links.

This helps us meet the cost of maintaining our website and producing great articles.\r\n\r\nWhy grow bamboo?\r\nThere are dozens of reasons to plant bamboo in your garden. But before you get started, you need to think about YOUR reasons for growing bamboo. Because your reasons will play a very important role in determining which varieties of bamboo you want and where you want to plant them.\r\nPerhaps you want to grow bamboo for a privacy screen. This is one of the most common reasons why people plant bamboo. Many varieties of bamboo grow very quickly and get very tall and bushy, like a hedge. Some even grow up to 50 or 60 feet high, tall enough to provide privacy in your upstairs in windows.\r\n\r\nBut maybe privacy is not a concern, and you just want some beautiful bamboo to decorate you garden. You’ll want something that looks good with your landscape. A lighter, yellowish bamboo could bring a good contrast. Or dark canes with deep green might work better.\r\n\r\nAre you going for a Japanese garden look, or just something tropical? Do you want an eye-catching centerpiece with unique character in the middle of your garden? Or just a some accents alongside an already established landscape? Bamboo could accomplish any of these things.\r\n\r\nIf your property is spacious, bamboo could be just the thing to fill some of that empty space and cover it quickly with greenery. Do you want to hear thick canes knocking in the window, or just the light rustle of leaves? If you have sloping land or waterways, bamboo’s complex roots are also ideal for erosion control.\r\n\r\nWith a small garden, in a suburban neighborhood or even an apartment, you may be better off keeping your bamboo in a pot. You might even want an indoor plant, which could be tricky, but not impossible with bamboo.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe none of these practical and aesthetic purposes mean anything to you. You might just be interested in sequestering as much carbon as possible, and producing the maximum amount of clean oxygen. Bamboo is great for that, too.\r\n\r\nLike I said, the reasons for planting bamboo are almost endless. You could just be aspiring botanist, or even an accomplished botanist, dazzled by the fact that bamboo is both a wood and grass. And with as many as two thousand species and subspecies, you’d like to cultivate as many varieties as you possibly can.\r\n\r\nChoosing the best variety of bamboo\r\nOnce you’ve given some deep thought to why you’re growing bamboo and what you want to get out of it, you can make a better decision on which variety or varieties to plant. You’ll also need to consider how much space you have in your garden. Finally, you need to be aware of your local condition. Your climate zone and soil type will have a significant effect on how your bamboo performs.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about selecting the right species, check out our articles on How to Choose the Best Bamboo and 10 Best Bamboo varieties for your garden.\r\n\r\nRunning or Clumping Bamboo?\r\nRunners without borders\r\nUsually, when people think of bamboo varieties, they split them into two categories. First you have your running bamboos, with their notoriously aggressive rhizome roots. This unstoppable growth habit has earned bamboo a bad reputation in some gardening circles.\r\n\r\nRunning bamboos have no respect for property lines or antique rose gardens. They can tear up your lawn, and your neighbors’ lawns. They can also wreak havoc on your sprinkler system, even your plumbing and your gas line. Bamboo has even been known to get into the exterior walls of a house.\r\n\r\nAnd when you (or your neighbor) finally decide you’ve had enough, you’ll have your work cut out for you. Removing a well-established grove of running bamboo can be one of the greatest challenges in a master gardener’s play book. Bring out all your heavy tools, including a pick ax and a saws-all. You might even need to rent a back-ho.\r\n\r\nRun for your life\r\nBut it doesn’t have to be like this. Unfortunately, a lot of amateur bamboo enthusiasts will run to the hardware store and grab a few inexpensive pots of golden bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea). Because it grows so prolifically, or invasively, it’s quite easy to propagate. For that reason it’s pretty inexpensive and easy to come by. But it can be a monster when you let it loose in your garden.\r\n\r\nAll members of the genus Phyllostachys are runners and should be handled with care. Luckily, you can easily recognize a Phyllostachys by the prominent groove (sulcus) that runs along the length of each segment (internode).', 'How-to-grow-bamboo-1080x675.jpg'),

Of course, 10,000 years ago, there were a lot fewer people around to exchange gardening tips. But it’s also true that more and more people today are recognizing bamboo for its utility, versatility, aesthetic beauty, and all-around sense of good joo-joo.\r\n\r\nThough it’s been revered in the Far East for these same qualities for many thousands of years, it’s taken a few extra centuries for this thing of wonder to reach the west and spread like wildfire. Not unlike a few other things I can think of.  Yoga and sushi quickly come to mind.\r\n\r\nAs if sorting through the options of bamboo toothbrushes and bamboo towels weren’t challenging enough, consider now that if you’re looking to plant a few varieties of bamboo in your garden, you’ll have between 1-2,000 species to choose from. Even the bamboo specialists can’t agree on the actual number of bamboo breeds. But no need to split hairs over speciation. Today we’d like to help you narrow it down to the 10 best bamboo varieties for your garden.\r\n\r\nBotanical name	Common name	Description\r\nPhyllostachys vivax	Chinese timber bamboo	Giant bamboo with yellow canes; up to 50′ tall and 4″ thick; runner\r\nSemiarundinaria fastuosa	Temple bamboo	Slender, elegant canes; dark green foliage; runner\r\nPhyllostachys nigra	Black bamboo	Attractive, dark brown poles; 20-30′ tall and 1-2″ thick; runner\r\nPseudosasa japonica	Arrow bamboo	Long, straight poles; about 15′ tall and 1″ thick; runner\r\nPleioblastus viridistriatus	Dwarf green stripe	Compact ornamental; maximum 2-3′ tall; runner\r\nBambusa oldhamii	Oldham’s	Very attractive timber bamboo; clumping\r\nOtatea acuminata 	Mexican Weeping Bamboo	Slender stems and cascading foliage; up to 15′ tall; clumping\r\nBambusa vulgaris	Buddha’s Belly	Very unusual culm shapes; up to 40′ tall; clumping\r\nBambusa multiplex	Alphonse Karr	Beautifully striped, long straight canes; clumping\r\nHimalayacalamus hookerianus	Himalayan Blue	Attractive and exotic with powdery blue culms; clumping\r\n\r\nМеньше\r\n\r\nTwo Types of Bamboo\r\nSome people like to say that there are types of bamboo: runners and clumpers. Of course, that’s a sweeping generalization, because, like I said, there are really something like 1-2,000 species of bamboo. Not only that, but there are also slow runners and open clumpers, and a number of other factors that could affect the growth habit of your bamboo. Having said that, this still remains the simplest way to think of bamboos.\r\n\r\nRUNNING BAMBOO\r\nMost bamboos are runners, meaning that they send out rhizome roots racing underground in pursuit of moisture and elbow room. If you’re looking to plant a privacy hedge that will spread quickly along a fence line, or you just enjoy watching a voracious plant as it wields its dominion over the landscape, then this is the way to go. They also tend to be the easiest to find, especially at non-specialist nurseries, because they do propagate so easily.\r\n\r\nBut be careful, and think before you plant. The old adage about bamboo says that, “The first year they sleep, the second year they creep, and the third year they leap.” In other words, you might not think it’s a runner after the first year, but by the third or forth year, you almost certainly will, and so will your neighbors.\r\nRunning bamboos have no respect for property lines. If the neighbor to the one side is regularly sprinkling his perfectly manicured lawn, or the neighbor on the other side is constantly irrigating her prize-winning rose bushes, it won’t take long (especially in a dry place like California) for those eager rhizomes to sniff out those delicious water sources and wreak havoc on the roses, the lawn, the vegetable patch, the herb garden, and pretty much everything in sight. There goes the neighborhood!\r\n\r\nSo how do you avoid this un-neighborly catastrophe? Here are a few options:\r\n\r\nAllow your running bamboo plenty of room to spread. If you’re gardening in a tightly-squeezed suburban subdivision, then you probably will not have plenty of room. If you’re trying to fill out and green up some vacant acreage, then that’s more like it.\r\nKeep you bamboo well-contained. There are a number of ways to do this, ranging from a simple solution like planting into a old wine barrel (or half barrel) to burying any manner of rhizome barrier into the ground. Just remember, with time and pressure, there’s almost nothing that stop those roots from spreading. So whatever you put into the ground, plant it thick and deep. (Check out our tips on bamboo containment.)\r\nGet your hands dirty and prune your bamboo regularly. That means not only trimming back the shoots, but going underground and cutting back those vigorous roots.\r\nLook for smaller and slower running bamboos, like some of the ground cover varieties. But keep an eye on them. Sometimes they look sleepy on the surface, even while the roots are constructing an invisible empire underground.\r\nFind some clumping bamboo and plant those instead. (See below.)\r\nAlso check out our recommended list of bamboo gardening supplies.\r\nThe fact is, many of the most interesting and attractive bamboo species are runners. They also tend to be less expensive and easier to find in nurseries. So now that you’ve been warned, here are a few great bamboo varieties to look for.', 'best-varieties-of-bamboo-large.jpg'),
(4, 2, 'Running bamboo: Why must you run?', 'running', 'Bamboo has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Indeed, some tropical varieties can grow more than a meter a day in the growing season. Pull up a cozy chair and you can actually watch it grow.', 'Bamboo has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Indeed, some tropical varieties can grow more than a meter a day in the growing season. Pull up a cozy chair and you can actually watch it grow.\r\n\r\nRunning bamboo has earned a particularly nasty reputation for its growth habits. That’s because those rhizome roots spread like crazy. Although in this case, you can’t actually watch them grow. But it’s led many gardeners to wonder whether planting bamboo might not be such a good idea after all.\r\n\r\nWhat is a running bamboo?\r\nAmong the 90 genera and roughly 1,500 species of bamboo, we like to divide them into two simple categories. Basically, we have runners and clumpers. The most widespread genera of runners are the Phyllostachys and Pleioblastus. Runners generally perform better in temperate climates.\r\n\r\nRunning bamboo has a distinctively vigorous rhizome root system. The monopodial or leptomorph rhizomes tend to grow horizontally, parallel to the ground, spreading outward and overtaking an area. As the horizontal rhizomes extend outward, they eventually produce fresh shoots, new culms, growing upward. Sometimes, but not always, these monopodial bamboos can spread very aggressively. They can definitely become invasive. They can tear up your lawn, crawl under fences, and become very difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nYou might not notice this aggressive growth habit right away, but in time you will. In fact, there is an old adage which perfectly describes the behavior of running bamboo. “The first year it sleeps, the second year it creeps, the third year it leaps.” It typically takes a full season or entire year for a new bamboo plant to get established. Then the rhizomes begin to spread underground and get a solid foothold. Finally, the new shoots begin emerging from this underground network, and you realize that the bamboo is a real force of nature.\r\n\r\nBamboo rhizomes running vs clumping\r\nClumping bamboos, by contrast, are happier in the tropical and subtropical climes. Bambusa is the most prevalent genus of clumping bamboo. Like all bamboo, clumpers also have rhizome roots, but they are what’s called sympodial, or pachymorph. These sympodial rhizomes mostly grow close together, branching out often, to create a tight cluster of culms. It’s unlikely for a clumping bamboo to become invasive.\r\nWhy would you want to plant running bamboo?\r\nWith so much potential to be invasive and disruptive, why would anyone want to plant a running bamboo? That’s a very good question. But as it turns out, there are a few good reasons to plant a runner instead of a clumper.\r\n\r\nDefinitely check out our article on the 10 Best Bamboos for your Garden.\r\n\r\nClimate\r\nWhen selecting anything to plant in your garden, one of the chief factors will always be the climate. And when you think of bamboo, you probably think of places like Hawaii, Southeast Asia and Central America. In other words, the tropics. Indeed, bamboo thrives in these regions, especially the clumping varieties of bamboo.\r\n\r\nBut most of us don’t live in the tropics. And for those of us who do, there’s usually already plenty of bamboo around. But for the rest of us, we need something more adaptable. No problem. There are many varieties of bamboo indigenous to the more temperate zones of Asia, including China, Korea and Japan. And as it happens, these temperate bamboos usually belong in the running category.\r\n\r\nThe largest genus of these more temperate Chinese bamboos is Phyllostachys. They do very well in a range of climates, and they are definitely runners. Nurseries throughout most U.S. states and Europe can sell Phyllostachys and other temperate runners and feel good knowing they will probably thrive.\r\n\r\nSo planting a running bamboo actually makes a lot of sense if you live in a more temperate zone. But these runners aren’t the only varieties that can grow in a cool climate. If you’re living outside the tropics and trying to avoid planting a runner, keep an eye out for varieties of Bambusa like Oldhammi, genus Chusquea, and most any bamboo from the genus Fargesia.\r\n\r\nYou might also have a look at our article on Cold Hardy Bamboos.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Phyllostachys is also one of the easier bamboo varieties to identify. Look for the distinctive grooves that grow along the length of the internodes, alternating from one side to the other.', 'Running-bamboo-roots-on-the-run.jpg'),
(5, 2, 'Timber Bamboo: The greatest of grasses', 'timber-bamboo', 'Webster’s Dictionary defines timber as wood prepared for use in construction or carpentry, or trees grown for that purpose.

Bamboo, however, is not a tree. All species of bamboo belong to the grass family, Poaceae. Whether it’s a dwarf bamboo, just a few inches tall, or a timber bamboo that exceeds 100 feet in height, all bamboos are grasses.\r\n\r\nWhich species of bamboo do we refer to as timber bamboo?\r\nTimber bamboo is not a particular species of bamboo. The common term can refer to any number of bamboos that will grow to about 3-5″ in diameter and at least 30 to 50 feet tall, comparable in height to a good sized tree. Some species can exceed 100 feet. But despite their size and the quality of their wood, they are not trees at all.\r\n\r\nThere is no strict definition of a timber bamboo based on specific genetics or minimum dimensions. Some species actually employ the phrase “timber bamboo” in their common names. Other varieties of bamboo simply evoke the term based on their indisputably great size and stature.\r\n\r\nThe following table includes a few of the species that are mostly referred to as timber bamboos. Also check out our in-depth articles on Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, Guadua and Phyllostachys.\r\n\r\nBotanical name	Common name	Description\r\nPhyllostachys vivax	Chinese timber bamboo	Running bamboo, 40-60 feet tall, 4-5″ thick\r\nPhyllostachys bambusoides	Madake, or Japanese timber bamboo	Running bamboo, 50-80 feet tall, 3-5″ thick\r\nPhyllostachys edulis	Moso bamboo	Most important commercial variety, up to 100 feet tall, 5-6″ diameter\r\nGuadua angustifolia	Giant Guadua	South American clumper, 50-100 feet tall, several inches thick\r\nDendrocalamus asper	Giant bamboo	Tropical Asian clumper, 50-80 feet tall, several inches thick\r\nDendrocalamus sinicus	Dragon bamboo	From Laos, with giant culms over 150′ tall and 1 foot wide\r\nBambusa chungii	Blue timber bamboo	Clumping bamboo, 30-35 feet tall, 2 inch canes\r\nBambusa emeiensis var.

Vittata	Painted bamboo	Clumping bamboo, 30-40 feet tall, 3-4 inch canes\r\n\r\nПоказать больше\r\nHow fast does timber bamboo grow?\r\nFor a grass to get 40 or 50 or 80 feet tall, it has to grow incredibly fast. Unlike trees, which add a little height to their apex every year, a bamboo shoot will reach its full height in a single growing season. In order to achieve this, these giant bamboo specimens must grow at least several inches a day. And some of them can actually grow as much as three feet in a day.\r\n\r\nIs it invasive?\r\nThe answer to that question depends on which type of timber bamboo we’re looking at. Any member of the genus Phyllostachys is going to be a runner, and as such it has the potential to become invasive. The rhizome roots of running bamboo are leptomorph, growing horizontally and always spreading. So without proper containment, they can really take over.\r\nOn the one hand, the culms and roots of these giant bamboos are too big to sneak around unnoticed, unlike more modestly sized species. But their sheer size is going to make them a force to reckon with. You can only saw through so many 5″ bamboo poles before your arm starts to cramp up. Powers tools might be a better idea.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, a high quality root barrier is going to be one of your best weapons for controlling a running bamboo. But with specimens this large, the plant will probably knock out the barrier within the first year or two.\r\n\r\nYour better option will probably be to plant a clumping bamboo. The issue here is that most of the clumping varieties of timber bamboo are tropical or subtropical, native to Central America or Southeast Asia. So unless you live in a place like Florida or Alabama, your Dendrocalamus and Guadua specimens aren’t going to perform very well. You’ll be better off planting some Oldham’s bamboo, which does great in more temperate climates, even if it’s not especially cold hardy. If you’re in a climate with freezing winters, you’ll need to stick with one of the running species of Phyllostachys.\r\nFinally, even if you’re planting a clumper, these timber bamboos get huge. Some of them will grow as many as 100 culms before the clump stops spreading. So technically, they might not be invasive, but they are definitely going to take up some serious real estate.\r\n\r\nIs timber bamboo good for building?\r\nYes, bamboo makes an excellent building material, and for a number of reasons. In places like Central America and Indonesia, with very little heavy industry, Guadua and Dendrocalamus bamboos provide a very important building material. For trees to reach a comparable size, around 100 feet tall, it would usually take at least 20 or 30 years. But these bamboos get that big in a single growing season.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its tremendous growth rate, bamboo is also incredibly renewable. When these massive poles are harvested, you don’t have to start over and replant the forest. Bamboo is a grass, so as long as the root system and a few culms are left in place, new culms will begin shooting up almost immediately to replace the old ones.\r\n\r\nAnd bamboo’s hardness and resilience are as great as any actual lumber. The hardness of bamboo is often compared to that of steel. At the same time, bamboo has a flexibility that you simply can’t get out of a hardwood tree.\r\n\r\nTimber bamboo species list\r\nPhyllostachys vivax: This is one of the most popular timber varieties in North America. The giant, golden colored canes are impressive and attractive. Phyllostachys is one of the more cold hardy genera of bamboo, and this species is good down to about 5 or 10º F. They are also runners, which may be a point of concern, but in the colder climates they tend not to get so out of control, not like a Golden Bamboo or a Bisetti. In ideal conditions a Vivax bamboo can reach as much as 70 feet tall, but if they get to 50 feet you’re doing pretty well. The yellow culms grow to 4 or 5 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nPhyllostachys bambusoides: This is a slower growing variety of Phyllostachys (which can sometimes be a good thing). But once it reaches maturity you can enjoy the kind of bamboo grove where you can stroll through and listen to the poles knocking together in the breeze. Madake, as it is commonly known, is comparable to Vivax in size and cold hardiness. But the canes get slightly larger, and more importantly, they have very thick walls, making them ideal for building and construction. It seems to do best in USDA zones 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nPhyllostachys bambusoides Madake\r\nPhyllostachys edulis: One of the most important bamboo varieties in the world, Moso bamboo is the Chinese species used for making bamboo textiles, flooring and cutting boards. It grows best in southern China, but commercial bamboo farms are also sprouting up in Florida. This is the largest species of temperate bamboo, and grows up to 100 feet in its native habitat. In Florida it can get up to 70 feet high with culms 5 or 6″ thick. But it does not do well west of the Mississippi. Tender young shoots of Moso bamboo are also prized for eating.\r\n\r\nPhyllostachys nigra ‘Henon’: A better choice on the West Coast, where it performs much better than Moso and Madake, Giant Gray is a cultivar and possibly the original species of Black Bamboo. Unlike the common P. nigra, this variety has beautiful, towering, greenish-gray culms that can get up to 50 or 60 feet tall and more than 4 inches thick. Cold hardy to -5º or -10º F.\r\n\r\nGuadua angustifolia: Native to Central and South America, this neotropical variety is incredibly important for building in Colombia and other parts of Latin America. It does not grow well in the the US. But because of its superior wood quality, dried poles of Guadua are commonly imported for construction purposes. This massive bamboo easily gets 100 tall with canes 6 to 7 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nGuadua angustifolia timber bamboo species\r\nDendrocalamus asper: This giant clumping bamboo is the most important for building and construction in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. If you seen the incredible bamboo structures and pavilions at he Green School in Bali, that’s D. asper. These plants grow up to about 80 feet tall and several inches in diameter, with especially thick culm walls.\r\n\r\nDendrocalamus sinicus: A clumping variety only found in Yunnan, China and Laos, this species is believed to have the largest culms of any bamboo. Individual canes can reach over 150 feet high, with an outrageous diameter of 12 to 14 inches across. It’s not widely known and hardly used outside of Laos and the Yunnan Province.\r\n\r\nBambusa oldhamii: Probably the most widely grown bamboo in all of the United States, Oldham’s does well and looks beautiful in a wide range of temperate climates. It’s a clumping bamboo and won’t become invasive, yet it’s cold hardy down to about 20º F. The elegant canes usually grow about 50 feet tall and get about 4″ thick, and they are filled with thick, green foliage.\r\n\r\nBambusa vulgaris: Sometimes known as Golden bamboo. It can be confusing, because this one is an open clumping bamboo, and there’s also Phyllostachys aurea, also called Golden bamboo, which is an incredibly aggressive runner, though not nearly as large as B. vulgaris. This species also has a number of very interesting subspecies, or cultivars, including Giant Buddha Belly, or Bambusa vulgaris cv. Wamin.\r\n\r\nBambusa vulgaris, variation “Vittata”: One of several subspecies of B. vulgaris, this is an especially popular and attractive variety, often called Painted Bamboo, because of its distinctive markings. The culms are deep yellow with green stripes that vary in thickness and color.\r\nFurther reading\r\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider sharing it and subscribing to our blog.
